A Hotel Management school project

This Hotel Management System was implmented using Java, JSP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and JQuery.  
This was a graded project for CSUDH Software Engineer class.

In this project, I was the project manager, and was in charge of implementing the Front end and Database of the hotel management system.  
The group consisted of 4 members, and each had a task for the implementation of the system.  

Results:
  We had 3 months to work in this semester long project, and at the end, not every part of the system worked successfully.  Overall, the 
  front end and database worked perfectly, and our professor and classmates were impressed with the looks and feel of this system.
